<p>All over the world, while reading usually people read with fingering the word which results in one word at a time and this reduces their speed.
Here in this website readinspeed.com I ask user to upload his own .txt file which he wants to read, and then allow him to select or type his speed at which he wants to read eg: 200 words per minute and then press start button, based on the speed specified I start showing them the bunch of words at moment let say 5-6 words will form a bunch and will be instantly populating before their eyes, thereby increasing his visibly of words from one word at time of fingering to 5-6 words at the moment increasing width of eye visibility. You can check right know the effect at readinspeed.com</p>
